## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)
- PostgreSQL (Database)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pratik-udeshi1/medium-blog.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd medium-blog
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment.

    - On Windows:

    FLASK_ENV=development
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    DATABASE_URI=your_database_uri
    ```

    Replace `your_secret_key` and `your_database_uri` with your preferred values.

2. Initialize the database.

    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate
    flask db upgrade
    ```
